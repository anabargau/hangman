# Hangman
## What is it?
It is a console version of the popular game Hangman. It chooses a random word that you have to guess. You receive 10 guesses. It shows all the letters that you tried. At any point, you can save the game as it is. When you start again, you are asked if you want to start a new game or load a previously saved one.
